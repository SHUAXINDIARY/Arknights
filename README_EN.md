# Inspiration

On Weibo, I saw a post by [Red White RAW](https://weibo.com/u/2940601822) with the following image: ![](./src/assets/img_v3_02gq_7ed31f29-4562-44e3-b3e9-fc76fea30ecg.png). It made me think that to get more people involved, an online platform for easy data entry and generation would make it more fun.

Additional information:
The original table author's ID is at the bottom of the image. They also have an account on XHS, as shown below:
