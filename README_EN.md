# Inspiration

I saw it on Weibo posted by the old guy from [红白色RAW](https://weibo.com/u/2940601822) ![](./src/assets/img_v3_02gq_7ed31f29-4562-44e3-b3e9-fc76fea30ecg.png). Then I thought that in order to get more people to play, an online support for input could be set up to make it easier to generate, and then it would be more fun.
